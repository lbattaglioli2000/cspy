                <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
                <p>We want you to learn the key fundamentals of programming so you can apply them to learn higher level languages such as Java or C#. You will learn to use code to solve real problems. We will learn things such as functions, classes and objects, file input and output, and many more interesting topics. As discussed above, weâ€™ll have final projects to help enforce the skills we've learned and actually get you to apply them, and create something that is actually pretty cool, and useful.</p>
